My favorite demonstration of this tool involves the relativistic Doppler effect. The red person starts at **(0, 0)** and moves with a velocity of **0**. The blue person starts at **(0, 0)** and moves with a velocity of **0.6c**. The red person emits a pulse of light every second, so light pulses start at **(ct, x) = (n, 0)**, where **n** is a positive integer, and they move with a velocity of **1c**.

If we transform to a different frame of reference where the blue person is at rest, it becomes clear that the blue person receives a pulse of light every 2 seconds. This is consistent with the theoretical result:
